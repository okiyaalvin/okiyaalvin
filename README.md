## 🧠 About Me

I'm a passionate and results-driven **Cybersecurity Analyst** with experience in SOC operations, penetration testing, SIEM monitoring, and threat detection.

🔐 I specialize in:
- Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing (VAPT)
- Security Event Monitoring (Wazuh SIEM, Sysmon)
- Scripting & Automation (Python, Bash)
- DNS, Network Recon, & Log Analysis
- Cloud Security (AWS, Azure)
- Incident Triage & Technical Reporting

I enjoy working in controlled lab environments, building projects that emulate real-world threats, and helping organizations improve their security posture.
